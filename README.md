I made this just as a test to see if I could get a Blazor WASM application to run on github pages. From making this, I've had little experience in making or using blazor but I like blazor it's just not always pratical for some web projects.

I plan to experiment and add offline functionality as more websites should have this feature (it's really cool to use a website without internet). The blazor application is currently running now.

I was going to remove this once I figured out how to do it, but I thought it would be a great idea to keep it for future reference and for anyone else needing a minimal example of how to do this.
